This work expands upon the previously published _Massey et al._: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00830/full?report=reader. In particular, we employ a Bayesian approach and apply the model to data from three PDX lines. The preprint of this work can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.07.471540v1.

All of the necessary data can be found in 'data.xlsx'.
The 'RunSims.m' file is a MATLAB script that produces the results in the manuscript.
